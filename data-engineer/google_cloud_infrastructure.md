## BigQuery Database

BigQuery is a serverless, future proof data warehouse with numerous features for machine learning, data partitioning, and segmentation. BigQuery lets you analyze gigabytes to petabytes of data using ANSI SQL at blazing-fast speeds, and with zero operational overhead.

## Firestore Database

Firestore is a serverless document database with super fast document lookup and real-time eventing features. It is also capable of a 99.999% SLA. To use data in Firestore to test your app, you must initialize Firestore in native mode, then import the sample data into a storage bucket.

```

```

## App Engine

App Engine is a serverless compute platform that is fully managed to scale up and down as workloads demand. Go apps are compiled to a single binary executable file during the deployment. Cold Start (zero instances running) request initial response times are often between 80 and 1400 milliseconds. Hot (at least 1 instance running ) requests are fulfilled immediately.


Deploy an application to App Engine
```
gcloud app deploy app.yaml --project $PROJECT_ID -q
```
