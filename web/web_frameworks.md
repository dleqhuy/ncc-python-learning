## Overview

A web framework (WF) or web application framework (WAF) is a software framework that is designed to support the development of web applications including web services, web resources, and web APIs. Web frameworks provide a standard way to build and deploy web applications on the World Wide Web.

It is a collection of packages or modules which allow developers to write Web applications (see WebApplications) or services without having to handle such low-level details as protocols, sockets or process/thread management.

Generally, frameworks provide support for a number of activities such as 
 - URL routing and interpreting requests (getting form parameters, handling cookies and sessions, authentication)
 - producing responses (presenting data as HTML or in other formats)
 - integrating with some frontend javascript technology (AJAX, angular, reactjs, etc)
 - storing data persistently, ORM, caching and so on
 - ability to run and manage migrations
 - basic security features such as XSS and CRSF prevention
 - support for feature or unit-testing
 - Inbuilt development web server
 - logging
 - external modules, libraries management

Many frameworks now provide an element of customization in their support for the above activities and abstractions, utilizing components in that they provide abstractions only for certain specific things. As a result, it can be possible for you to build your own full-stack framework almost entirely from existing components.
