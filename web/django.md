The Django framework is one of the most used Python web frameworks for developing large-scale web applications and websites. It tends to follow the MVC architecture minutely enough to be known as an MVC framework. 

This Python web development framework uses its ORM (Object Relational Mapper) for mapping objects to multi-database tables which allows the code to work across multiple databases and template engines to make it easier to migrate from one database to the other. 

Django provides a range of inbuilt libraries and database support â€“ MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL, and Oracle. The Python MVC framework also supports other databases and templating systems via third-party adapters, drivers, and content management systems.
