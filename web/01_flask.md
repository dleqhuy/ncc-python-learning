Flask is another well-known and best Python framework that comes under the Microframework category and comes with the BSD license. It is inspired by the Sinatra Ruby framework.

Thanks to the functionality, restful request dispatching, request handling, modular, and lightweight frontend design of Flask, it is more adaptable than Django.

 - Install Flask and any necessary dependencies by running pip install flask in your command line.
 - Create a new Flask project by creating a new directory and a file called app.py inside it.

```python
# project_folder/app.py
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)
```

 - In the app.py file, import Flask and create a new Flask application.
 - Use the @app.route decorator to create routes for your website. For example, you can create routes for the homepage, product page, and checkout page.

```python
# project_folder/app.py
@app.route('/')
def index():
    return 'Hello, World!'

@app.route('/product/<product_id>')
def product(product_id):
    return 'Product ' + product_id

```
 - Use the render_template function to render HTML templates for each of your routes. These templates can be stored in a "templates" directory within your project directory.

```python
# project_folder/app.py
from flask import render_template

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')
```

 - Create a database to store information about products, orders, and users. You can use a library like Flask-SQLAlchemy to interact with the database.

```python
# project_folder/app.py
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:////tmp/test.db'
db = SQLAlchemy(app)

class Product(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String(80))
    price = db.Column(db.Float)
```

 - Create forms for adding products, processing orders, and handling user information. You can use a library like Flask-WTF to handle form validation.

```python
# project_folder/forms.py
from flask_wtf import FlaskForm
from wtforms import StringField, FloatField, SubmitField
from wtforms.validators import DataRequired

class ProductForm(FlaskForm):
    name = StringField('Name', validators=[DataRequired()])
    price = FloatField('Price', validators=[DataRequired()])
    submit = SubmitField('Save')
```

 - Implement user authentication and authorization using a library like Flask-Login.

```python
# project_folder/app.py
from flask_login import LoginManager, UserMixin, login_user, logout_user, login_required

login_manager = LoginManager()
login_manager.init_app(app)

class User(UserMixin):
    def __init__(self, id, name):
        self.id = id
        self.name = name

@login_manager.user_loader
def load_user(user_id):
    return User.get(user_id)

@app.route('/login', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def login():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        username = request.form['username']
        user = User.get(username)
        login_user(user)
        return redirect(url_for('index'))
    return render_template('login.html')

@app.route('/logout')
@login_required
def logout():
```

 - Add payment processing functionality using a service like Stripe.

## Test and deploy your website.

Here are some general steps to deploy a Flask website:

1. Choose a hosting service: There are many hosting services available, such as Heroku, AWS, GCP, and DigitalOcean. Each service has its own set of features and pricing plans, so you will need to choose one that best fits your needs.
2. Create a new app on your hosting service: Follow the instructions provided by your hosting service to create a new app. This will typically involve creating a new account, and then creating a new app within that account.
3. Install the necessary dependencies: Make sure that you have all the necessary dependencies installed on your server. You can use a requirements.txt file to keep track of all the packages that your app depends on.

You can use the pip command to generate this file:
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt

```

4. Configure your app: You will need to configure your app to run on the hosting service. This may involve setting environment variables and configuring the web server.
5. Push your code to the server: Use Git or other version control system to push your code to the server. This will typically involve creating a new Git repository on the server, and then pushing your code to that repository.
6. Start your app: Once your code is on the server, you will need to start your app. You can use a process manager like Supervisor or systemd to manage your app's process.
7. Test your app: Once your app is running on the server, you should test it to make sure that everything is working as expected.
8. Set up a domain name: To make your app accessible to others, you will need to set up a domain name. You can purchase a domain name from a registrar like GoDaddy or Namecheap.
9.  Set up SSL certificate: It is recommended to use https protocol on your website to ensure the security of the data being transmitted. You can use Let's Encrypt or other providers to set up SSL certificate for your website.
