    "## Working rules\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make sure you understand the requirement\n",
    "- When in doubt - donâ€™t guess! Ask questions!\n",
    "- Do research for solution and Ask questions!\n",
    "- First make it work then make it pretty\n",
    "- Embrace the unknown - Stay curious!\n",
    "- Discuss with other developer if you change his code\n",
    "- Keep commitment!\n",
    "- Always test the code locally before submitting for review\n",
    "- Write down document as much as possible\n",
    "\n",
    "## Readability and maintainability: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Is the code readable as written?  \n",
    "- Does it require additional comments, better naming, or general refactoring to be easily understood?  \n",
    "- Does the code generally conform to the style of coding for the project?\n",
    "- use code standard ([PEP8](https://www.zenesys.com/blog/python-coding-standards-best-practices))\n",
    "- internal review before submitting\n",
    "- Names are simple and if possible short\n",
    "- Names are spelled correctly\n",
    "- No hardcoded constants that could possibly change in the future\n",
    "- There is no commented out code\n",
    "- Debugging code is absent\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "## Quality and expandability:\n",
    " - All variables are in the smallest scope possible\n",
    " - There is no dead code (inaccessible at Runtime)\n",
    " - No code that can be replaced with library functions\n",
    " - Variables are not accidentally used with null values\n",
    " - Code is not repeated or duplicated\n",
    " - No complex/long boolean expressions\n",
    " - No empty blocks of code\n",
    " - Ideal data structures are used\n",
    " - Catch clauses are fine-grained and catch specific exceptions. Exceptions are not eaten if caught unless explicitly documented otherwise\n",
    " - Blocks of code inside loops are as small as possible\n",
    " - Code is unit-testable and is covered at least 70%\n",
    " - each function contain a (very) brief comment describing functionality, inputs, and outputs\n",
    " - Design patterns if used are correctly applied\n",
    " - A class should have only a single responsibility\n",
    " - Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface\n",
    " - Depend upon Abstractions. Do not depend upon concretions\n",
