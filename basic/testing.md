## Testing the Code

Tests are made using pytest framework.

You may add new tests for yourself by adding files and functions with test_ prefix (i.e. test_topic.py with def test_sub_topic() function inside).

To run all the tests please execute the following command from the project root folder:
```
pytest
```

To run specific tests please execute:
```
pytest ./path/to/the/test_file.py
```
