## Overview
Amazon Aurora is a fully managed, MySQL-compatible, relational database engine that combines the performance and reliability of high-end commercial databases with the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of open-source databases. It delivers up to five times the performance of MySQL without requiring changes to most of your existing applications that use MySQL databases
## Conclusion
