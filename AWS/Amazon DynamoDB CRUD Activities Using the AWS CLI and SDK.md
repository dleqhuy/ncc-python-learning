## Overview
Amazon DynamoDB is a serverless NoSQL, also known as nonrelational, database that supports key-value and document data models. With DynamoDB, you can start small and quickly scale globally as your application and user base grows, with the ability to support petabytes of data and tens of millions of read and write requests per second. AWS manages the DynamoDB service, so there are no servers to update or maintain. For more information, refer to
