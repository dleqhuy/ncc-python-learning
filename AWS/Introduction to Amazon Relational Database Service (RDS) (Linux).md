## Overview
Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes it easy to setup, operate, and scale relational databases in the cloud. It allows you to create and use MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, or Microsoft SQL Server databases. This means the code, applications, and tools you already use today with your existing databases, can be used with Amazon RDS.
