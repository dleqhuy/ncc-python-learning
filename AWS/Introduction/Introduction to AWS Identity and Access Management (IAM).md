## Overview

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that enables Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers to manage users and user permissions in AWS. With IAM, you can centrally manage users, security credentials such as access keys, and permissions that control which AWS resources users can access.

 1. Uses: an account for a single individual so that they can access AWS resources
 2. group: a group allows you to manage permissions for a group of IAM users
 3. Roles: this enables us to either have a user or a service assume permissions to perform a specific task

## Conclusion

I have successfully:
- Explored pre-created IAM users and groups: permission
- Inspected IAM policies as applied to the pre-created groups
- Followed a real-world scenario, adding users to groups with specific capabilities enabled
- Located and used the IAM sign-in URL
- Experimented with the effects of policies on service access
