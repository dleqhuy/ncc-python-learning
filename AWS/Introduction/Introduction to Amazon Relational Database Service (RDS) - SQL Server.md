## Overview
Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes it easy to setup, operate, and scale relational databases in the cloud. It allows you to create and use MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle or SQL Server databases. This means the code, applications, and tools you already use today with your existing databases can be used with Amazon RDS.
With Amazon RDS for SQL Server, you can deploy multiple editions of SQL Server (2008 R2, 2012, 2014 and 2016) including Express, Web, Standard and Enterprise in minutes with cost-efficient and re-sizable compute capacity. Amazon RDS frees you up to focus on application development because it simplifies many database administration tasks including taking backups, software patching, monitoring, hardware scaling, and designing for high availability.
