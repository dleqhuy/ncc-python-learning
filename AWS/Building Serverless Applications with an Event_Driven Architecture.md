## Overview
Serverless is the native architecture of the cloud. You can build serverless architectures for nearly any type of application or backend serviceâ€”without thinking about servers. This type of architecture eliminates infrastructure management tasks such as server or cluster provisioning, patching, operating system maintenance, and capacity provisioning. Everything required to run and scale your application with high availability is handled for you.

Serverless enables you to shift more of your operational responsibilities to Amazon Web Services (AWS), increasing your agility and innovation and lowering your total cost of ownership. Your developers can focus on their core product instead of worrying about managing and operating servers or runtimes, either in the cloud or on premises. This reduced overhead lets developers reclaim time and energy that can be spent on developing great products that scale and are reliable.
## Conclusion
I have successfully:
- Understood an event-driven architecture
- Understood how Step Functions is configured to orchestrate serverless applications
- Taken advantage of Amazon SQS and SNS
- Created and configured Lambda functions and API Gateway resources
- Made configuration updates to restore API functionality
