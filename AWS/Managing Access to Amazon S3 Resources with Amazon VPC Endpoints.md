## Overview
Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) endpoints allow you to provide Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances controlled access to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets, objects, and Application Programming Interface (API) functions without requiring an Internet gateway or Network Address Translation (NAT) device. In this lab, you implement an Amazon VPC endpoint to facilitate communications between an Amazon EC2 instance in a private subnet and an Amazon S3 bucket. You also create a bucket policy to only allow connections to the S3 bucket through the VPC endpoint.
## Conclusion
I have successfully:
- Implemented VPC endpoints to facilitate communications between an EC2 instance in a private subnet and an S3 bucket.
- Created a bucket policy to only allow connections to a bucket through a VPC endpoint.
- Turned on Amazon S3 Versioning for a bucket.
- Restored a deleted object.
