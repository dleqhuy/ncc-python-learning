## Overview
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a collection of digital infrastructure services that developers can leverage when developing their applications. These services can be provisioned on-demand via multiple methods, such as automatically deploying services based on a schedule and intelligently responding to infrastructure events.

This lab demonstrates how to automate AWS by showing three way to access and manage AWS services:
- AWS Management Console : This is a web application for managing Amazon Web Services. The console provides an intuitive user interface for performing many AWS tasks, such as working with Amazon S3 buckets, launching Amazon EC2 instances, and setting Amazon CloudWatch alarms.
- AWS Command Line Interface (CLI): The AWS CLI is a unified tool to manage your AWS services. With just one tool to download and configure, you can control multiple AWS services from the command line and automate them through scripts.
- AWS Software Development Kit (SDK): AWS provides SDKs for numerous programming languages including Java, .NET, PHP, Go and Ruby. Using an SDK, you can build applications on top of Amazon S3 and Amazon EC2. This lab will use the SDK for the Python scripting language.
## Conclusion
I have learned how to:
- Use the AWS CLI to access and manage AWS services from the command line
- Use the AWS SDK to programmatically access and manage AWS services
- Configure security for the AWS CLI
